* org-import-simplenote

Import Simplenote archives into Org.

1. Go to Simplenote → Settings → Tools → Export Notes
2. A =notes.zip= should be downloaded
3. In an Org buffer, run =org-import-simplenote= and select the zip file
   - This requires =7z= to be installed.
   - Alternatively, unzip the file yourself then select the =notes/source/notes.json= file
4. Each Simplenote item will be imported as an Org heading (might be customizable in the future)

** Requirements

- p7zip (=7z=) to unzip the exported archive for you
- Should work from Emacs 24 onwards, though I've only tested it in Emacs 24 and 25 using the unit tests

** Configuration

- org-import-simplenote-title-format ::

  By default (with this option set to =timestamp=), notes are imported like this:

  #+begin_src org
  ,* 2021-12-07T23:31:25+0900
  :PROPERTIES:
  :created:  2021-12-07T23:31:25+0900
  :END:

  first line

  text content
  #+end_src

  To use the first line as the title, set this to =first-line=, which will import notes like this:

  #+begin_src org
  ,* first line
  :PROPERTIES:
  :created:  2021-12-07T23:31:25+0900
  :END:

  text content
  #+end_src

  Or use =both=:

  #+begin_src org
  ,* 2021-12-07T23:31:25+0900 first line
  :PROPERTIES:
  :created:  2021-12-07T23:31:25+0900
  :END:

  text content
  #+end_src

** Todos

- [ ] Import Simplenote IDs as well (as either the =ID= property or the =CUSTOM_ID= property; the former probably works better)
- [ ] Import the last modified timestamp
- [ ] Customize the property name
