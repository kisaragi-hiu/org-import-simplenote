* org-import-simplenote

Import Simplenote archives into Org.

1. Go to Simplenote → Settings → Tools → Export Notes
2. A =notes.zip= should be downloaded
3. In an Org buffer, run =org-import-simplenote= and select the zip file
   - This requires =7z= to be installed.
   - Alternatively, unzip the file yourself then select the =notes/source/notes.json= file
4. Each Simplenote item will be imported as an Org heading (might be customizable in the future)

** Requirements

- p7zip (=7z=) to unzip the exported archive for you
- Should work from Emacs 24 onwards, though I've only tested it in Emacs 24 and 25 using the unit tests

** License

GPLv3. See [[./LICENSE][LICENSE]].
